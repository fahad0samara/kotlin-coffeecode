# Kotlin Coffee Code App

Welcome to the Kotlin Coffee Code App! ☕️

## Overview

The Kotlin Coffee Code App is a feature-rich Android application built using the MVVM architecture. It leverages Room Database for data persistence, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit and Ktor for network requests, and Jetpack Compose for the UI. Additionally, Google Sign-In is used for authentication.

## Features

- **Cart Screen:** View and manage items in your shopping cart. The cart screen provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to add, remove, and update quantities of coffee items.

- **Search Screen:** Easily find your favorite coffee items using the search functionality. The app dynamically filters coffee items based on user input, providing a smooth search experience.

- **Favorite Screen:** Mark your favorite coffee items and access them in one place. The favorite screen allows users to quickly navigate to their preferred drinks.

- **Profile Screen:** Personalize your profile within the app. Users can view and modify their profile information, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Coffee List Screen:** Explore a comprehensive list of coffee items available in the app. Users can scroll through various coffee drinks, each with detailed information and enticing images.

## Architecture

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, promoting a clean and modular codebase. Jetpack Compose is used for building the user interface, providing a declarative and concise way to create UI components.

## Libraries and Technologies

- **Dagger Hilt:** Dependency injection framework for managing app components.

- **Room Database:** Local database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Ktor:** Networking libraries for handling API requests.

- **Jetpack Compose:** Modern Android UI toolkit for building native user interfaces.

- **Google Sign-In:** Utilized for user authentication.
